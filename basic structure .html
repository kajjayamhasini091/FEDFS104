    Once upon a time, nestled in the heart of a vibrant forest, lived a little squirrel named Squeaky.
     Every autumn, Squeaky tirelessly gathered acorns, his tiny paws deftly carrying them to his secret stash,
 high up in the hollow of a ancient oak tree. He was known for his meticulous planning and a slight anxiety about the approaching winter, 
    unlike his carefree neighbor, a plump rabbit named Barnaby who always seemed to think the sunny days would last forever.
